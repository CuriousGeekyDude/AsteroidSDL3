# AsteroidSDL3

## Still an ongoing project

## Requirements
You need to have a x64 computer and your C++ compiler needs to be able to support C++20.

## How to build

1) Run the build.bat. It will generate the solution automatically.
2) Run the generated solution and happy compiling!


## How to use
You can use the WASD to move the ship around. In order to be able to rotate the ship using mouse you have to press the key C. If the mouse is not captured via the mentioned method,
the bullets will not shoot and the ship won't be able to rotate. After capturing the mouse, it will become invisible. You can then try shooting as many bullets as you want via 
the key F. You can hide/unhide the ImGui demo bar by pressing F1.
